<h1 align="center">👑 OnlyKing – Rule the Moment</h1>

<p align="center">
  <em>OnlyKing is a daily interactive challenge arena where one winner becomes the King—for a day.</em>
</p>

## 🌟 Overview

**OnlyKing** is a dynamic social platform where creativity meets competition. Every day, users from around the world submit a response to a global challenge. At the end of the day, one winner is crowned “The King,” gaining special powers to engage with others in fun, daring ways.

With a bold, gamified approach to expression and interaction, OnlyKing turns daily challenges into a stage—and anyone can rule it.


## ✨ Features

* 📣 **Global Daily Challenge** – One prompt per day. One shot to submit your best creative entry—text, photo, video, or audio.
* 🕗 **Timed Submissions** – Entries close at a set time daily (e.g. “Submit by 8PM”), with countdown and reminders.
* 🧑‍⚖️ **Manual Winner Selection** – The admin selects the winning entry, who then becomes the King for the next 24 hours.
* 👑 **Winner Powers** – The King can:

  * Send dares to 1–3 selected users
  * Control the arena (mute/spotlight participants)
  * Broadcast to everyone via live stream
  * Pin announcements and highlight responses
* 🔁 **Selected User Interactions** – Users who receive dares respond with voice/video/text in a live “Dare Room.”
* 👀 **Viewer Mode** – Everyone else can watch the action unfold, switch views, send emoji reactions, and follow favorites.
* 🧑‍💼 **Private Admin Panel** – Control challenges, view submissions, pick winners, and reset the arena when needed.

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Target Audience

* **Content Creators & Performers** – Showcase creativity in a competitive, daily spotlight.
* **Teens & Gen Z Users** – A fun and interactive way to engage with challenges and dares.
* **Social Explorers** – Viewers who love spontaneous, live, and community-driven content.

## 💡 Unique Value

Unlike typical social apps, **OnlyKing** creates a daily rhythm where:

* A new challenge drives participation.
* A single winner gains temporary powers.
* Everyone gets to watch, react, and return tomorrow for a fresh round.

It's not about likes—it's about winning the moment.
